A simple but highly configurable tournament registration form providing shortcodes for form, list, editor and export views. It is mainly intended for registering players with hobby sport events.

== Description ==

WP Tournament Registration is a plugin that provides shortcodes intended for registering players with hobby sport events. As a matter of fact, it was made for the championship of my [local chess club](https://schach-goettingen.de/). There are four shortcodes for different views:

* `[wptournregedit tournament_id="myID" /]` is an editor for the players' data.
* `[wptournregexport tournament_id="myID"]...[/wptournregexport]` is a plain text export filter
* `[wptournregform tournament_id="myID"]...[/wptournregform]` is a form where people can register with the competition. It covers some `[wptournregfield field="fieldname" /]` shortcodes which customize the desired inputs.
* ` [wptournreglist tournament_id="myID" /]` is a sortable list view of all approved participants.

All these shortcodes are customizable through a set of optional attributes. 

= Available fields =
* `address` [text]: self-explanatory.
* `affiliation` [text]: club or association.
* `approved` [checkbox]: entries become visible in in the list view or through the export filter only afer approved was checked.
* `birthyear` [integer]: self-explanatory
* `city` [text]: self-explanatory.
* `custom1`, `custom2`, `custom3`, `custom4`, `custom5` [text]: if anything is missing.
* `email` [text]: self-explanatory.
* `fee_is_paid` [checkbox]:  self-explanatory.
* `firstname` [text]: self-explanatory.
* `id` [read-only]: an integer that serves as primary key and is incremented with every registration. Use it to separate entries if people register twice.
* `ip` [read-only]: The remote IP of the submitter through `wptournregform`. May be useful for security checks.
* `lastname` [text]: self-explanatory.
* `message` [textarea]: self-explanatory
* `phone1` [text]: self-explanatory
* `phone2` [text]: self-explanatory
* `postcode` [integer]: self-explanatory
* `protected` [checkbox]:  if checked, all contact data of the particiapant are suppressed in list view.
* `rating1` [integer]: a rating that is used to calculate ranking lists.
* `rating2` [integer]: another rating that is used to calculate ranking lists.
* `time` [read-only]: a timestamp that records the exact date and time of submitting.
It is advisable not to misuse fields since there are some internal checks on the values. Use the custom fields instead. It is hard to say what the length of input fields is in characters as this depends on what is going to. But all are of reasonable length for their purpose.

= Usage =

The first example is a registration form. Several `wptournregfield` shortcodes are wrapped by a `wptournregfield` one. You can put HTML elements between (fi. fieldsets) in order to design your form:

`[wptournregform tournament_id="my_tournament" css_id="my_tournament" email="subscription@example.com"]<p>Red labels indicate required fields!</p><fieldset><legend>Who you are</legend>[wptournregfield field="lastname" label="Family name" required="1" /][wptournregfield field="firstname" label="Christian name" required="1" /][wptournregfield field="affiliation" label="Club" required="1" placeholder="or 'free agent'" /][wptournregfield field="rating1" label="DWZ"  /]</fieldset><fieldset><legend>Your contact data (not to be published)</legend>[wptournregfield field="email" label="E-mail" /][wptournregfield field="phone1" label="Phone 1" required="1" /][wptournregfield field="phone2" label="Phone 2" /]</fieldset>[wptournregfield field="message" label="Your message" placeholder="Whatever you like to tell us." /][/wptournregform]`

The next instance is an editor for the data of the tournament. The non-approved players are highlihted in the selection list:

`[wptournregedit tournament_id="my_tournament" display_fields="approved,firstname,lastname,affiliation,email,id,time,ip,rating1,phone1,phone2,protected,custom1,message" /]`

Next is a list view. Normally you will make an password restricted full list for internal use and a small one for the public. Only approved players are on view:

`[wptournreglist tournament_id="my_tournament" display_fields="lastname,firstname,affiliation,email,phone1,phone2,message" headings="Last Name,First Name,Club,E-mail,Phone 1, Phone 2, Message" /]`

The next shortcode exports all participants into a csv list which than the is loaded into a tournament manager app (Swiss-Chess in this case). Here also non-approved players get exported. Wrap the field names in sections signs (`§`) in order to output the respective value.

`[wptournregexport tournament_id="my_tournament" all="1" format='"§lastname§, §firstname§";"§affiliation§";"";"";"§rating1§";""' linebreak="1" filename="swiss-chess.txt"]Download Swiss-Chess list[/wptournregexport]`

The following shortcode exports a list of all approved participants who have provided you with a mail address in a way you can directly copy and paste into a mail client. See FAQ for issues with some characters!

`[wptournregexport tournament_id="my_tournament" format='"§firstname§ §lastname§" LOWER_THAN§email§>,' fields_set="email" filename="mails.txt"]Download mail list (use BCC!)[/wptournregexport]`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to escape characters in export formats? =

The shortcode is rendered as HTML which means that there are some protected characters. Fi. if you need tabsops, provide them as HTML entities (`&#9;` in this case).
A special issue is the `<`. The format method strips HTML tags (and some other things) in order to avoid injection of evil scripts, even as HTML entity. `LOWER_THAN` will be substituded by a `<`.

= Where is the settings page? =

No settings page at all! Everything is done with shortcodes.

= How about multisite? =

WP Tournament Registration employs a single database table on multisite installs. This is
desired behaviour. Fi., if a multisite provides different language versions of the same site, 
then you can provide a registration form in every language for the same tournament. For protecting
a site against others it is probably a good idea to namespace your tournament IDs somehow, eg. 
`mysite_mytournamentid` 

= Why does it work with JavaScript enabled ony? =

WP Tournament Registration does some checks to avoid spam.
